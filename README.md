Tell me about yourself? 

Hello everyone, thank you for visiting me today. My name is Minh Truong, and I'm a highly motivated data analyst with 4 of experience in finance field.

After serving 4 years in the US Army as a Financial Analyst, I've processed, managed, and reported on over $10M in Government funds for deployed troops. I decided to leave the Army to discover something new in my life. I want to become a Data Analyst/ Data Engineer.

In my role as a Financial Analyst, I use SQL and Python to analyze data and identify trends and patterns that inform strategic decisions and recommendations. I also use Power BI and Tableau to create informative and actionable dashboards that visualize data and communicate insights. I am passionate about delivering accurate and timely financial information and supporting the Army's mission and values. 

I enjoy working with diverse and collaborative teams and learning from different perspectives and experiences. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to new challenges and opportunities in the data industry.
